# Tech-interview-handbook converter

This script converts the online [tech-interview-handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/) into a single-file self-contained html file to be exported as PDF or ePUB.

Warning: It doesn't contains the original styles and there are some conversion issues.

## How to run

    $ cd path-to-project/tech-interview-handbook
    $ git submodule init

    $ cd path-to-project
    $ bundle install
    $ thor book:build

The book should be created at output/book.html

## How does it work

It uses Thor gem to wrap the script and it uses YAML for various configuration (such as title, sections and so on, see: config/)

### Actions

- Loads config/config.yaml to determine various settings
- Loads config/content.yaml to determine the sections and articles
- Creates the title and TOC with the information from config/content.yaml
- Does some pre-parsing (search and replace) over the articles
- Uses github-markup gem to convert .md to .html
